Spaceborne is a code for the fast and accurate computation of the analytical photometric probes (weak lensing, photometric galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing) covariance matrix for modern cosmological analyses.
Some of its features include:

* Easy to use: all settings are detailed (along with type hints) in the `yaml` example config file, with further explanations in the [readthecods](https://spaceborne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) page.
* Extensively validated against simulations and other public codes.
* Interfaced with CCL and cloelib (soon), two of the most modern and extensive cosmological libraries.
* Different statistics available: $C(\ell)$ and 2PCF
* Python native: written entirely in pure Python, with no low-level interfaces (e.g., C/C++ wrappers). This makes the code highly accessible, transparent, and easy to modify.
* JAX-accelerated: the most intensive computations are optimised using JAX, seamlessly providing multi-device (CPU, GPU, TPU) support.
* ... and much more!


For detailed instructions on how to install and use Spaceborne, please refer to the official [documentation](https://spaceborne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

To install Spaceborne within a dedicated `conda` environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/davidesciotti/Spaceborne.git

# Checkout the latest release (version tag); e.g., git checkout v2025.07.1
git checkout <latest_version_tag>

# Enter the Spaceborne root directory you just cloned
cd Spaceborne

# Create the conda environment. This step can be slow; add --solver=libmamba 
# to speed it up (see below for more details)
conda env create -f environment.yaml

# activate the newly created conda environment
conda activate spaceborne

# Finally, install Spaceborne
pip install .
```

### Some notes

‚ùó The only stable versions you should consider are the code releases. Please avoid simply cloning and installing the code from the `main` branch.
**As the code is evolving quite quickly at the moment, please make sure to check for new [releases](https://github.com/davidesciotti/Spaceborne/releases) periodically**
Moreover, installation is only supported in a dedicated Conda environment, for the time being (installation via PyPI is work in progress).

üêç To significantly speed up the environment creation, install `mamba` by running `conda install mamba` in your `base` environment., then do

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yaml 
# or
conda env create -f environment.yaml --solver=libmamba 
```

üîµüü¢üü£ Spaceborne leverages `JAX` for computationally intensive tasks. This is included as 
a `pip` dependency in the `environment.yaml` file. If you want to run the jax-optimised 
parts of the code on an NVIDIA GPU, after creating and activating the enviromnent do

```bash
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"
```

Please refer to the [official installation instructions](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#installation) for more accurate, up-to date and platform specific 
(see Silicon Macs) intructions.

## Running the Code

All the available options and configurations can be found, along with their most up-to-date explanation, in the `config.yaml` file. To run `Spaceborne` _with the configuration specified in the_ `Spaceborne/config.yaml` _file_, simply execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

If you want to use a configuration file with a different name and/or location, you can instead run with

```bash
python main.py --config=<path_to_config_file>
```

for example:

```bash
python main.py --config="path/to/my/config/config.yaml"
```

To display the plots generated by the code, add the `--show-plots` flag:

```bash
python main.py --config="path/to/my/config/config.yaml" --show-plots
```

Additionally, in the `config.yaml` file you can set `save_figs: True` to save the figures in the `<output_folder>/figs` path.

## Using Docker üêã

If you find issues with the installation, you can happily disregard the above instructions and run the code through Docker. To do this, install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or the [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/); then, in the root of the cloned repository (again, remember to checkout the latest release), run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Note that the `--build` flag is only needed the first time you run the code (or if you modify the `environment.yaml` or `Dockerfile`, which is **highly discouraged**). For subsequent runs, simply do:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Finally, to stop the container, do

```bash
docker-compose down
```

That's it! The container will use your local `config.yaml` file and output to the directories specified in your configuration, just as if you were running locally.
