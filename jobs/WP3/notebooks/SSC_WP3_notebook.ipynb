    "Super-sample covariance is a form of cosmic variance arising from the coupling of density modes with wavelenght larger than the linear survey size $L$ (\"super-survey\" modes) with modes with wavelenght shorter than $L$. This coupling is caused by non-linear evolution, which mixes modes with different wavelength.\n",
